 The assumptions and design plan is as follows -  1.Student can take multiple classes.1 to 4 students come together and become a group.  2. Each group does one project. Project is unique (Project_ID) to a group i.e no two groups will work on the same project.  3. Each project can be supervised by multiple Professors, but only one professor at a time. 
A supervisor bridge table is maintained to record the number of hours overseen by each professor for a particular project.  4. Each professor can teach multiple courses. One course can also be taught by multiple professors.  5. A Syllabus  bridge table is maintained to note down the book suggested by each professor per course. Total number of of hours taught per course is also maintained in this table for a professor.  6. A library contains books with book ISBN as primary key. Students can borrow upto 0 or 4 books. Books can be referenced separately by Book ISBN to know the Name, Author and edition.  7. Each group works on the project on a table.  The schedule for working on the table is provided in Schedule table.  8. One table can be provided to multiple projects at different timings. Table is given a box based on its project_ID. A table_num at a particular schedule can be assigned to only one group.  9. Box contains all the parts required - Microcontroller, sensors etc. The damaged or not condition is also noted in the box table.  10. Each Hardware Part present in the table has additional info from the Parts table. Parts table has cost, the supplier, description and cost as its attributes.   The ID for each part per supplier is maintained i.e sensor provided by Supplier A has different ID from same sensor provided by Supplier B.  11. Institute  table is maintained to have STEM institute ID’s and location. An institute can place multiple orders through order relationship to multiple suppliers.   12. Student gives rating to professor ,course taught and project is maintained in Ratings table  13. Fees paid by students is maintained in FeesPaid table
